                <p>Did you ever wonder how far you are from maxing out your Old School Runescape Account?<br>Wonder no more.
                This can calculate exactly how much more experience you need to max. </p>

                <h5>How is works?</h5>
                <p>Just like on the official OSRS site for viewing player hiscores, you select a game mode and enter an RSN to view player stats.
                    This site does the same thing with a little math at the end :)
